# person-classification
 Person classification is a supervised learning problem that uses Logistic regression algorithm : define a set of target classes (objects to identify in images), and train a model to recognize them using labelled example photos.The main motto of the project is to build a website where user can drop an image of the person and the website will provide the details of the person as to which person in trained data it is matching and with how much accuracy in percentage. Project is restricted to only 5 classes which means to provide only any 5 persons whose details will be extracted in drop by user. In this study, image detection technology edge detection, grayscale processing, object capture, target recognition, etc are combined with the actual needs of persons to achieve a variety of needs for person image detection.
